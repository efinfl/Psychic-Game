https://efinfl.github.io/Psychic-Game/

 
 
 In this game, the user attempts to guess the computer's randomly chosen letter. The user gets 9 guesses. Every time a guess is made, it gets displayed so that the user can keep track of what's already been guessed. If the user guesses correctly within those 9 attempts, a win is added. If not, a loss is added.
